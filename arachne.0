.SH NAME
.B arachne 
\- wickedly useful spider robot visualization and simulation

.SH DESCRIPTION (short)
arachne is a heatherly application built bottom-up to simulate, review,
test, and validate a frightening array of hexapod/spider robot movements.
this is a lynch-pin application for my robotics efforts.

.SH DECISION PROCESS

.B situation (s).  
spider robotics is a magnificently insane proposition.  as nature has proven,
a spider is infinitely flexible, adaptable, and capable.  for robotics,
spiders represent an apex challenge.

.B complication (c).  
given a minimum of 18 degrees-of-freedom for mobility alone, spider robotics
is a mind-meltingly complex field and graceful results are almost impossible
for mere mortals.

.B problem statement (p).  
this is core to my future.  how do i become a true master?  i must to learn
from all the gifted practitioners while remaining truly independent and learn
all the frightening details.

.B answer (a).  
i will build a series of interlocking capabilities, each focused on a specific
aspect of spider robotics.  each will be built from the ground-up as my own
code and design.

.B objectives (o).  
   -- fully testing and accurate kinematics using opengl as the benchmark
   -- expansive spider movement scripting meta-language
   -- predict servo positioning issues without real-life experimentation
   -- controlled using completely standard vi-keys (zero mouse/touch)
